title: "Nothing Runs Between Two Clicks"
number: 24
part: day
blurb: "the long report, the busy indicator, the timer and the job"
description: "A roundtrip occupies one dialog work process for as long as main( ) runs, and nothing runs between two roundtrips. What that means for a report that takes two minutes: the busy indicator, splitting the work, a background job, and a timer that polls it."
---

[#7](/insights/07-one-click-one-request/) made a claim that sounds harmless
until the first long report: nothing runs between two clicks. No thread
waits, no promise resolves later, no controller ticks in the background. A
roundtrip starts when the browser posts, ends when `main( )` returns, and in
between the app is a row in a table.

The dialog world handled the long case with an hourglass. A report ran for two
minutes in the foreground, `SAPGUI_PROGRESS_INDICATOR` told the user how far
it had got, and anything longer went to `SM36`. All three have an answer here,
and the answers are as unexciting as the questions.

**A long `main( )` is a long dialog step.** The roundtrip occupies one dialog
work process for as long as `main( )` runs, and the runtime limit Basis
configured for dialog steps applies to it the way it always did. The browser
waits patiently: after one second the UI5 busy indicator covers the screen,
clicks that land meanwhile are dropped rather than queued, and only after ten
minutes does the frontend give up with *No backend response within 600
seconds*. For a `SELECT` that takes four seconds, nothing has to be written at
all.

What does not exist is progress *during* a roundtrip. The response is one
string that arrives when `main( )` is done, so a percentage written halfway
through has nobody to read it.

**Work that is long because it is big is split.** A thousand documents are a
hundred per roundtrip, with the position in an attribute and the next chunk
started by the app itself. That turns one blocking request into a sequence the
user can watch — and cancel, which the two-minute dialog step never offered.

**Work that is long because it is long goes to a job.** The app schedules it —
`JOB_OPEN`, `SUBMIT ... VIA JOB`, `JOB_CLOSE`, or the
`cl_apj_rt_api` of ABAP Cloud — keeps the job's name in an attribute, and asks
for its status on a timer:

```abap
    CASE abap_true.
      WHEN client->check_on_event( `START` ).
        job_schedule( ).            " remembers job name and count
        poll( ).
      WHEN client->check_on_event( `POLL` ).
        status_read( ).             " TBTCO, or the API of ABAP Cloud
        IF status <> `F` AND status <> `A`.
          poll( ).                  " not finished: ask again
        ENDIF.
    ENDCASE.
```

```abap
  METHOD poll.
    " one backend event in three seconds - without the busy overlay
    client->follow_up_action( val   = client->cs_event-start_timer
                              t_arg = VALUE #( ( `POLL` ) ( `3000` ) ( `X` ) ) ).
  ENDMETHOD.
```

`cs_event-start_timer` raises one backend event after a delay, and it is
deliberately small: one timer per app, and every roundtrip cancels it, so a
timer only keeps ticking while each response re-arms it. A poll ends the
moment the app stops asking, and an app the user has left polls nothing. The
third argument keeps the overlay down for the tick, so the screen stays usable
while the poll runs.

The job itself runs where batch work always ran, in a background work process,
with its log in `SM37` and none of the dialog limits. The screen is what it
was in the GUI: a view on the job, not the job.

**Push instead of poll.** Where polling every few seconds is too slow or too
chatty, the frontend's `z2ui5:Websocket` control listens on an ABAP Push
Channel: the job — or anything else on the server — publishes through AMC, and
every message arrives in the app as an ordinary backend event, with no
JavaScript written
([WebSocket](https://abap2ui5.github.io/docs/cookbook/expert_more/websocket)).
That is an APC and an AMC to set up and operate, which is why the timer comes
first.

The timer, with the sample for a progress indicator and one for a view that
refreshes itself, is on
[Timer](https://abap2ui5.github.io/docs/cookbook/browser_interaction/timer).

The hourglass is now a busy indicator, the progress bar is a poll, and the job
is still a job.
