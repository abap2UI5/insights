# abap2UI5 Insights

Short technical essays about one idea: what happens when the ABAP server sends
the *screen* instead of only the data. What the framework rests on, how it
works under the app, what a working day with it looks like, where it belongs
in the landscape and what running it takes. The case for using it is the
why-site's, and linked.

**→ https://abap2ui5.github.io/insights/**

One of the abap2UI5 family of sites, next to the
[documentation](https://abap2ui5.github.io/docs/), the
[playground](https://abap2ui5.github.io/playground/) and the
[page for decision makers](https://abap2ui5.github.io/why/): its own
repository, build and deployment, nothing shared but the convention
(`CONVENTION.md` in abap2UI5/abap2UI5.github.io). Built with
[Astro](https://astro.build) into static pages without a script.

## Run it

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev       # http://localhost:4321/insights/
npm run check     # build + tests, what CI runs
```

## Where things are

| | |
|---|---|
| `src/content/essays/NN-slug.md` | the essays - one file each, the frontmatter carries title, number, reading order, part, the one-line blurb and the meta description |
| `src/lib/parts.ts` | the parts, in one place |
| `src/pages/index.astro` | the index |
| `src/pages/[slug].astro` | an essay, with the other essays of its part and previous/next; also the old addresses in `src/lib/moved.ts` |
| `src/pages/rss.xml.ts` | the feed |
| `src/layouts/Page.astro` | the document around every page: the family's top line, the policy, the foot |
| `src/styles/global.css` | the one stylesheet, the family's tokens copied in |
| `scripts/migrate.mjs` | brought the essays over from abap2UI5/docs; see below |
| `test/site.test.mjs` | what the built site must keep |

## Adding an essay

Create `src/content/essays/43-the-slug.md`:

```md
---
title: "The Title, Without the Number"
number: 43           # the place in reading order, the same as in the file name
part: running        # rests | how | day | where | running | coda
blurb: "one line, lower case, no period - the line in the index"
description: "optional: the meta description, a sentence"
---

The text. Links to a sister essay are `/insights/06-ui5-over-the-wire/`,
links to the manual are absolute (`https://abap2ui5.github.io/docs/...`),
a diagram goes to `public/` and is referenced as `/insights/43-name.svg`.
```

The number is the essay's place in reading order: the index, the feed, the
previous/next links and the part boundaries follow from `number` and `part`.
A new essay anywhere but at the end shifts the numbers - and the slugs - of
the essays after it; `AGENTS.md` lists what moves with them. `npm run check` tells you
if a link points nowhere.

## No script, no inline style

Every page carries a Content-Security-Policy of `script-src 'self';
style-src 'self'`, and `npm test` fails a build that contains a `<script>`
or a `style=""` attribute. Code is therefore highlighted by Prism (classes
the stylesheet colours), not Shiki (a style attribute per token). The ABAP
grammar is Prism's own.

## Migration from the docs

`scripts/migrate.mjs` read `docs/advanced/insights/` of abap2UI5/docs, took
the parts, the reading order and the blurbs from its index, wrote the essays
here with a frontmatter and rewritten links, and copied the SVGs - last run
against abap2UI5/docs at 88ba749 (#398). The essays left the docs in
abap2UI5/docs#399, so there is nothing to run it against any more: this
repository is their source, and the script stays for the record. The docs keep
a redirect stub for every old address; `AGENTS.md` says what that means for
renaming an essay.
